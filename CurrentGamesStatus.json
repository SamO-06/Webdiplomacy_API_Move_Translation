Must coordinate defenses between Munich, Ruhr, and Denmark while preventing French advance.\n\nThe moves align with my previous analysis - France's aggression through Burgundy poses the main threat, while England's northern expansion suggests they aren't immediately hostile. Russia's success in Galicia and Sweden creates potential future concerns but isn't an immediate threat. The priority remains countering France while maintaining position in Denmark.", "2": "England: Strong northern position with Norway and naval superiority in North Sea\nFrance: Aggressive expansion with four southern units threatening Germany directly\nItaly: Secured Tunisia and Mediterranean presence but limited northern options\nGermany: Defensive central position threatened by French buildup in Burgundy\nAustria: Solid Balkan control but exposed northern border with Russia\nTurkey: Contained position with limited expansion opportunities\nRussia: Successfully expanded west and south, controlling key strategic territories\n\nGoals: Defend against French pressure through Burgundy while maintaining Danish position.

Priority is protecting Munich-Ruhr axis from French pressure while preventing Russian northern expansion. Consider tactical alliance opportunities with England or France to stabilize position.\n\nThe previous assessment of defensive priorities was correct, but underestimated Russian expansion threat. French pressure appears less immediate than anticipated, while Russian gains are more concerning.", "5": "England: Strong naval position but struggling to maintain continental presence\nFrance: Dominant in west, consolidating position rather than Mediterranean focused\nItaly: Contained in central Mediterranean with limited expansion options\nGermany: Critically weakened in north, core territories under multi-directional threat\nAustria: Losing ground in Balkans but maintaining core defensive line\nTurkey: Static defensive position with limited offensive prospects\nRussia: Successfully executing two-front expansion strategy, strongest momentum\n\nGoals: Secure Munich-Ruhr line against potential French attack. Consider supporting England in Scandinavia to check Russian advance. Maintain army in Kiel as northern anchor. Focus on survival rather than expansion.\n\nAnalysis: Previous turn's events show Russia as primary threat rather than France. England's retreat to Finland suggests potential anti-Russian alignment opportunity. French moves indicate less immediate threat than previously assessed."}}}
