# Webdiplomacy_API_Move_Translation
Diplomacy is a classic turn based strategy game from 1959 that has been the subject of research for decades.
This project aims to create a bot to play the game using new AI tools in conjunction with the online platform
WebDiplomacy.net.

<h1>Important Note</h1>
The developer of this project was given explicit permission from the owner of WebDiplomacy to use the site
in the way that this project does. It is directly against the website's rules to use your WebDiplomacy
cookie to send in moves on your account, and a special bot API key is to be provided by the owner to those
who want to develop bots. For the sake of development, however, this is being worked around with the owner's
permission. 

<h1>Required Code</h1>
For this program to function, a valid WebDiplomacy cookie needs to be input, and a valid Claude AI API key
must be set as well. In its current state, this code will be able to detect games that need moves input,
return moves recommended by Claude, and send them to WebDiplomacy.
