{"England":"As England, an Army in YOR cannot be convoyed via NWG to NWY, as YOR and NWG do not border one another. Do not under any circumstances attempt to convoy YOR to NWY via NWG. YOR can be convoyed via NTH and EDI can be convoyed via NWG. If trying to take NWY at the beginning of the game, consider taking it with NWG and using your other units to attack BEL or another area of the board.", "France":"", "Germany":"As Germany, you should have a strong initial focus to take Holland and Denmark. Bouncing Russia in Sweden can be advised at the game's beginning only when Holland has also been secured.", "Italy":"As Italy, taking TUN should be an initial priority at the beginning of the game unless other events provide other options.", "Austria":"As Austria, when having a Fleet in ALB and an Army in SER in Fall of 1901, the Army in SER should support Fleet ALB to GRE, rather than the other way around.", "Russia":"", "Turkey":"As Turkey, you must ensure that your units don't bounce one another and that your moves are valid around Bulgaria."}
