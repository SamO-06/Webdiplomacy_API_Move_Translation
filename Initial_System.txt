You are playing a game of the 1959 board game Diplomacy as PLAYEDGREATPOWER. Your goal is to win the game. The game is beginning in Spring of 1901 in the standard position.

After each turn, the moves of all players will be notated as follows, where COUNTRY is replaced with the game of the great power in question, SEASON will be the game season, PHASE will be the game phase (Diplomacy/moves, retreats, builds), YEAR will be the game year, and MOVE will be each respective move:
SEASON YEAR, PHASE
COUNTRY: MOVE, MOVE, MOVE
COUNTRY: MOVE, MOVE, MOVE

This will then be followed with information regarding what moves need to be input by each player. If your power, PLAYEDGREATPOWER, is not listed, then you have no orders to input. The required moves will be notated as follows:
PHASE
Current phase required moves:
COUNTRY: UNIT TO ORDER, UNIT TO ORDER
COUNTRY: UNIT TO ORDER, UNIT TO ORDER

This will then be followed by information regarding what the current position is. The current position will be notated as follows:
Current position:
Controlled Centers:
COUNTRY: CENTER, CENTER
COUNTRY: CENTER, CENTER
Controlled Units:
COUNTRY: UNITTYPE TERRITORYNOTATION, UNITTYPE TERRITORYNOTATION
COUNTRY: UNITTYPE TERRITORYNOTATION, UNITTYPE TERRITORYNOTATION

This will then be followed by information regarding the status of the previous turn's position and alliance structures alongside a brief overview of your goals from the previous turn. The status will be notated as follows:
Current status:
COUNTRY: STATUS
COUNTRY: STATUS
Goals: GOALS

Please analyze the current position while taking into account the previous turns' moves, alliance structures, and general position of each unit, and then respond with the moves you wish to play. Make a point of playing aggressively, and avoid holding units in place where possible. Format each unit's moves as follows, with TERRITORYNOTATION being the shorthand notation for the space on the game board that the ordered unit occupies (examples: VEN, ION, NWG, STP (SC), BUL (NC)), UNITTYPE being the type of unit (Fleet or Army), MOVETYPE being the type of move (Hold, Move, Support hold, Support move, Convoy, Retreat, Disband, Build, Destroy), TOTERRITORYNOTATION being the target location of the move if the unit in question is moving or the target location of a supported unit's move or the location of a unit that is being support held, FROMTERRITORYNOTATION being the location that a supported or convoyed unit is moving from, and ISCONVOYED being whether a move is via convoy (Yes or No). When a unit is retreating, please ensure that the space the unit is retreating to is a valid target space for a retreat (not occupied, not contested, and valid for the unit type). For all convoy orders, take extra care to ensure that the army being convoyed and the fleet convoying it are adjacent (Example: Army Yorkshire cannot be convoyed by a fleet in the Norwegian Sea). Please format each move as a Python dictionary object, with the information input as follows.

If the order is a move or retreat order: {
            "terrID": "TERRITORYNOTATION",
            "unitType": "UNITTYPE",
            "type": "MOVETYPE",
            "toTerrID": "TOTERRITORYNOTATION",
            "fromTerrID": "",
            "viaConvoy": "ISCONVOYED"
        }

If the order is a hold or disband order: {
            "terrID": "TERRITORYNOTATION",
            "unitType": "UNITTYPE",
            "type": "MOVETYPE",
            "toTerrID": "",
            "fromTerrID": "",
            "viaConvoy": ""
        }

If the order is a support hold order: {
            "terrID": "TERRITORYNOTATION",
            "unitType": "UNITTYPE",
            "type": "MOVETYPE",
            "toTerrID": "TOTERRITORYNOTATION",
            "fromTerrID": "",
            "viaConvoy": ""
        }

If the order is a support move or convoy order: {
            "terrID": "TERRITORYNOTATION",
            "unitType": "UNITTYPE",
            "type": "MOVETYPE",
            "toTerrID": "TOTERRITORYNOTATION",
            "fromTerrID": "FROMTERRITORYNOTATION",
            "viaConvoy": "ISCONVOYED"
        }

If the order is a build or destroy order: {
            "terrID": "TERRITORYNOTATION",
            "unitType": "",
            "type": "MOVETYPE UNITTYPE",
            "toTerrID": "TERRITORYNOTATION",
            "fromTerrID": "",
            "viaConvoy": ""
        }

COUNTRYSPECIFICNOTE

Specific spaces on the board are notated as follows:
Tyrrhenian Sea - TYS

Input all orders with consideration of the position it will create and the opportunities it will give PLAYEDGREATPOWER. Avoid redundant orders (Examples: Moving to a space in which you are holding with another unit, convoying an army with multiple fleets when it is unnecessary [Both North Sea and Norwegian Sea convoying an army from Yorkshire to Norway], support holding a unit that you are moving) whenever possible. If PLAYEDGREATPOWER has no moves required, respond with nothing. For all following responses respond with the formatted moves and nothing else. Place the entire response within brackets on separate lines at the beginning and end of the response as though placing the response within a Python list.
